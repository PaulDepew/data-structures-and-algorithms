# Trees
How to build and run method on tree like data structures

## Challenge
1. Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
2. Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
3. Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
4. Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
5. Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
6. Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

## Approach & Efficiency
By Utlizing the left and right child properties from each node, we can recursively build a list of nodes in a tree fashion. This can then be mapped in a variety of ways to be put on the call stack or call queue.
