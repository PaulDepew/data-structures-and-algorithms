# Hashtables
Create a hashtable that allows for a hashed index key to be found in an O(1) time.

## Challenge

- Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

`add`: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
`get`: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
`contains`: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
`hash`: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
Create a hashed array
Create a hashed key value
Add the value to the hashed array at the hased key value
