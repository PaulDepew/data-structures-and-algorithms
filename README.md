1. Array Reverse





# Reverse an Array
Take an array and output the array in reverse

## Challenge
How to reverse an array with unstandard practices. 

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to take the array and reverse through the loop to try and take the values from the end first, then find a way to make or remap the array to the new values. 

## Solution
![I looped through the array backwards and pushed the values to a new array. I then returned that array.](https://imgur.com/a/D4YmLl3)
